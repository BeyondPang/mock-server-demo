# mock-server-demo

An example of a simple test case using **MockServer**

MockServer can be used for mocking any system you integrate with via HTTP or HTTPS (i.e. services, web sites, etc).

MockServer allows you to mock any server or service that you connect to over HTTP or HTTPS, such as a REST or RPC service.

This is useful in the following scenarios:
 1. testing
 1. de-coupling development
 1. isolate single service
